<p>This project focuses on predicting wind power generation using the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The dataset employed in this analysis comprises key attributes such as air temperature, pressure, wind speed, wind direction, and power generation.</p>
<br>
<p>The model provides insights into the wind power generation patterns based on the input attributes. The predictions generated by the model can be utilized to optimize energy production, assess potential variations, and enhance resource planning.</p>
